Chocolate sales analysis using SQL Server and the OSEMN framework to uncover business insights.

## üìå Project Overview

This project analyzes a chocolate sales dataset to uncover trends, boost revenue, and support business decisions. Using SQL Server and structured frameworks like **OSEMN** and **SMART**, I transformed raw sales data into actionable insights for a fictional chocolate brand.

The dataset includes transactional records across countries, products, sales reps, and customer segments from January to August 2022.

## Key Insights

- **Top Products:** Smooth Silky Salty, 50% Dark Bites, White Choc
- **High Efficiency:** 3 products generate 25%+ of revenue
- **Top Regions:** Australia and USA lead in performance
- **Risk Alert:** 15.42% of all revenue comes from only 3 salespeople

## Conclusion & Recommendations

This project turned a raw sales dataset into a clear roadmap for better business decisions. Through SQL analysis and structured insights, we revealed:

-  Jan, Jun, and Jul are peak revenue months ‚Äî ideal for product launches
-  A small number of reps and products drive a majority of revenue
-  Australia and New Zealand show promising growth and deserve more investment
- ‚ö† A lack of correlation between boxes shipped and revenue challenges assumptions about volume-based selling

### Recommendations:
- Focus marketing and inventory on top 3 products
- Reduce over-reliance on top salespeople by upskilling or hiring
- Target high-growth regions (Australia, New Zealand) for campaigns
- Use this dashboard/analysis as a template for future data-driven decisions
